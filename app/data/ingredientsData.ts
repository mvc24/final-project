    description: `Aubergines or eggplants come in a lot of different sizes, shapes, and colours and can just about take on any flavour from all over the world.\n
    Those who do not like them have often made the acquaintance of undercooked ones, which is the one thing you should never do to it – better too dark than too light, trust me on that.\n
    They’re happy to be roasted in the oven, they can be halved and the flesh scored, cut into bite-size cubes, or thick slices. Mix them with olive oil, salt, and whichever spices you like. You might also want to add a bit of liquid at the beginning to help the flesh soften and become creamy.\n
    You can cook them in a pan or wok until nicely browned, or griddle slices in a grill pan. Boiling them in water is a decidedly bad idea.
    Classic recipes with aubergines include Caponata, Baba ghanoush, Aubergines with miso dressing, and Ratatouille.`,
    recipe: `One of the things I like to do is to mix a bit of honey with warm water, salt, olive oil and rose harissa and mix that with the aubergines before baking them at a moderately high temperature until they’re browned but not burnt. Add some fresh mint at the end, maybe a dollop of greek yoghurt and a piece of bread and you have a delicious and rather hands-off meal.`,

    description: `Beans come in a variety of shapes, colours, and sizes, and they are a versatile ingredient that can be used in various cuisines.\n

    While cooking beans from scratch isn’t at all difficult, I rarely have the forethought to soak them the day before, so I generally use them from a can. My favourites are white butter beans, they are creamy and lend themselves perfectly for making quick and comforting food.\n

    Beans can be the star of many delicious dishes. They can be used in soups, stews, salads, and even veggie burgers. You can also blend them into creamy dips like hummus or refried beans.\n

    Experiment with different spices, herbs, and seasonings to add flavour to your beans, there’s not many ways to go wrong. A bit of acidity brightens the dishes, be it from lemon or lime, a dash of vinegar, tomato (paste) or even pomegranate molasses.`,
    recipe: `One of my go-to recipes is slightly adapted from a Nigel Slater one, and has saved me countless times when I forgot to eat and only realised how hungry I was when my hands were shaking.\n

    Heat a little olive oil, butter or both in a pan, drain a can of beans and add them to the pan. Salt them and let them warm up, add some thyme or tarragon if you like. Meanwhile open a can of sardines or mackerels, drain them and add them to the beans. Season with some lemon juice and lemon peel, if you like. It takes maybe ten minutes from start to finish.`,

    description: `Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are versatile legumes that can be enjoyed in a variety of dishes. They have a creamy texture and a nutty flavour that adds depth to any recipe.\n

    Whether you prefer to use canned or cooked chickpeas, they are a great source of protein and can be a fantastic addition to vegetarian and vegan meals. You can toss them in salads, roast them for a crunchy snack, or blend them into creamy hummus.\n

    Some popular recipes with chickpeas include chickpea curry, roasted chickpea bowls, and chickpea salad. Get creative with your seasonings and toppings to make each dish unique and delicious.`,
    recipe: `My version of the Italian ‘Pasta e ceci’, pasta and chickpeas, is a staple on cold days where I want something warm and nourishing without putting much work into it.\n

    Heat some olive oil in a pot, add some dried rosemary and grated or finely cut garlic. Sauté until fragrant, then add some tomato paste. Drain a can of chickpeas and add them to the pot just when the tomato paste is beginning to brown. Meanwhile, boil some water in a kettle, add a good handful of small pasta per person to the pot and top with the water once it boils. Add a generous amount of salt – the pasta needs it – and cook at a medium-high heat it until the pasta reaches the consistency you like. Stir frequently, as the pasta likes to catch at the bottom, and it usually takes a little longer than it says on the packet, as you’re cooking it all in the same pot.`,

    description: `Fennel is surprisingly adaptable and aromatic vegetable that adds a unique flavour to a variety of dishes. It has a crunchy texture and a slightly sweet and anise-like taste.\n

    There are different ways to prepare fennel depending on your preference. It can be thinly sliced and enjoyed raw in salads for a refreshing and crisp bite. You can also roast or grill fennel to bring out its natural sweetness and enhance its flavour.\n

    Fennel pairs well with a range of ingredients and spices. It can be incorporated into soups, stews, and stir-fries to add a delicate and fragrant note. I particularly like cutting it into sizeable chunks and roasting it in a pan in olive oil, adding a little sugar and lemon juice once it starts to brown. The easiest way to prepare it is to cut it and separate its layers into bite-size pieces, tossing it with a little olive oil and salt and roasting it in the oven until slightly browned. Believe it or not, it’s simply addictive.`,
    recipe: `Cut a bulb of fennel into chunks, heat some olive oil in a pan and roast the fennel at fairly high heat with a good pinch of salt, until it starts to brown at the bottom, then turn it, adding some fennel seeds at that point. Once it’s nicely browned, reduce the heat, sprinkle it with some sugar, and add lemon zest and juice to the pan. If you have dried barberries or maybe sour cherries, add them at this point. Have an eye on the pan, as the caramelisation might happen rather quickly and go from delicious to black in a very short time. Serve as is, with some bread or pasta, or top it with some torn mozzarella, crumbled manouri or fresh sheep cheese – basically anything white and creamy works wonders. `,

    slug: 'kale',
    image: 'sage/fennel_eclibx',
    description: `Kale and cavolo nero are leafy greens belonging to the cabbage family that offer a wealth of flavours and textures to elevate your dishes.\n

    Kale, with its curly leaves and vibrant green color, has a slightly bitter taste that mellows when cooked. It can be enjoyed raw in salads, but then it might be a good idea to cut it into thin strips and massaging it with a bit of salt to make it soft and way more enjoyable. When cooked, kale becomes tender and develops a rich flavour that pairs well with garlic, lemon, and anchovies or parmesan (or both).\n

    Cavolo nero, also known as Tuscan kale or black kale, has long, dark green leaves that are more tender and less bitter than traditional kale. It is a staple in Italian cuisine and is often used in hearty soups, stews, and pasta dishes. Cavolo nero can be sautéed, braised, or even roasted to bring out its earthy and robust flavour.\n

    With both types it might be good to err slightly on the side of overcooking as they tend to remain a little tough and chewy. Many recipes tell you to throw away the stems, which I personally find really sad because they’re actually super tasty if cooked until soft.`,
    recipe: `This is a dish to brighten up dark winter days with bold flavours.
    \n
    Heat some olive oil in a wide pan with a lid. Take some cavolo nero or kale, wash it, and cut it into strips. Thinly slice some garlic and add it to the oil, together with some anchovies (or leave them out if you want to keep it vegetarian, but they do add quite a bit of depth to the flavour). Keep an eye on it, you don’t want the garlic to burn or it’ll turn bitter. Once the anchovies have dissolved and the garlic is translucent, add the greens. They take a lot of space but they will wilt quite a bit. Add some lemon zest and lemon juice and maybe a little bit of water, but often the water from washing the greens will suffice and cover the pan. They will need a few minutes, try a piece of the stem to see if it’s of the consistency you like. You’ll want the flavours to be strong and bright, so add more salt, chili or lemon to your taste.
    \n
    Either make some pasta to go with this or have some good, crusty bread to mop up the juices. I will often also boil an egg or two until just set, about 7 minutes to add when serving.`,

    description: `Although there are a great variety of different mushrooms that offer a wide range of flavours and textures in cooking, I decided to group them all together here. They come in various shapes, sizes, and colours, each with its own unique characteristics.
    \n
    Whether you prefer common button mushrooms, meaty portobellos, or delicate oyster mushrooms, there are countless ways to enjoy them in your meals. Mushrooms can be sautéed, grilled, roasted, or even stuffed with flavourful fillings.
    \n
    When cooked, mushrooms develop a rich umami flavour that adds depth to dishes. They can be used as a meat substitute in vegetarian and vegan recipes, or as a complement to meat and poultry in various dishes. Their earthy taste pairs well with garlic, herbs, and spices, allowing you to experiment with different flavour combinations.
    \n
    Mushrooms can be added to pasta dishes, risottos, stir-fries, soups, and stews. They can also be enjoyed in simple preparations, such as on top of toast with melted cheese or as a topping for pizzas.`,
    recipe: `Cook a portion of Japanese rice. Once the rice is almost done, heat some neutral oil in a wok or pan. Take oyster mushrooms and tear them into strips and add them to the wok at medium to high heat. Let them brown without stirring too much in the beginning. Once they’re nicely browned, add enough mirin to cover the bottom of the wok generously, better a bit more than not enough. Add a good splash of soy sauce and let it reduce. Add a generous piece of butter towards the end, stirring it until the sauce has reduced and the mushrooms are nicely glazed. Serve on the rice, maybe with some pickles on the side. Toasted sesame seeds make a lovely crunchy garnish.`,

    description: `Pumpkin and winter squash are vibrant and flavourful vegetables that add a delightful touch to a variety of dishes. With their distinct shapes, sizes, and colors, they bring a touch of warmth and richness to the table.\n

    Pumpkins are often associated with fall and are popular for making comforting dishes like pumpkin pie and roasted pumpkin soup. Their sweet and earthy flavour makes them a versatile ingredient in both sweet and savoury recipes. Pumpkin can be pureed for creamy sauces, diced for hearty stews, or roasted for a caramelised finish.
    \n
    Winter squash, such as butternut squash and acorn squash, offer a delightful sweetness and a smooth, buttery texture. They can be roasted, sautéed, or even turned into creamy soups. The natural sweetness of winter squash pairs well with warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, adding depth and complexity to dishes.
    \n
    Whether you're looking for a comforting soup or a hearty side dish, pumpkin and winter squash are sure to bring a touch of seasonal delight to your meals. Experiment with different cooking methods and flavour combinations to create dishes that are as beautiful as they are delicious.`,
    recipe: `Halve a butternut squash and scrape out the seeds. Score the flesh criss-cross, not cutting all the way through. That’ll help it to cook evenly and take on more of the flavours. Halve a clove or two of garlic and put them in the space where the seeds were before. Add a good spoonful of maple syrup, a chunk of butter each, some dried thyme and a good pinch of salt. Drizzle some maple syrup on the rest of the squash, add a few flakes of butter and a generous pinch of salt each and roast the squash in the oven at medium to high heat until it’s soft and caramelised, about 40 minutes but depending on the size, so keep an eye on it. If in doubt, err on the side of leaving it in a bit longer.
    \n
    Once it’s done you have several options, my favourite is to turn it into soup: Sauté some onions in a pot in butter until soft. Peel the squash once it’s cool enough to touch and add it to the onions. Add hot water and puree it once it’s boiled for a little while. Taste for salt and add a little bit of lemon juice to brighten it up, it can be quite sweet otherwise.
    \n
    Eat it like that, or add one of my favourite soup toppings: take a small pot or pan and melt some butter, stirring it and letting it boil until it’s starting to brown - it’ll foam quite a bit at that stage and start to smell nutty and delicious. At that point, turn down the heat and add some sage leaves cut into strips and some lemon zest. It’ll foam like crazy, stir it a little and take it off the heat, and top each plate of soup with a spoonful (or two) of the butter.`,

    description: `Tomatoes are beloved for their vibrant colors and juicy texture. Available in a variety of shapes and sizes, tomatoes bring a burst of freshness to countless dishes.
    \n
    Whether used in salads, sauces, or soups, tomatoes add a delightful tangy sweetness that enhances the overall flavour profile. Their bright acidity can balance out rich and savoury flavours, creating a harmonious taste experience.
    \n
    When out of season, or when used for soups and stews, canned tomatoes are a great option – preferably the whole, peeled ones. Tomato paste is a wonderful ingredient to add depth and a touch of acidity to a number of dishes. Add it once your aromatics like onion or garlic are softened and letting it brown lightly, taking care not to burn it.
    \n
    Tomatoes can be enjoyed in various preparations. They can be sliced and enjoyed raw, adding a refreshing and juicy element to sandwiches and salads. Alternatively, they can be roasted to bring out their natural sweetness, intensifying their flavours.`,
    recipe: `This is based on an Italian classic by Marcella Hazan, and is just about the easiest pasta sauce you can imagine. Take a can of good quality peeled tomatoes and put them in a small pot with a lid. Add a generous piece of butter (if in doubt, take a little more). Peel a small (but not tiny) onion and halve it and add it to the pot. Add a teaspoon of salt, cover the pot and set it on low heat. Leave it there for about 45 minutes, stirring every now and again after the first 20 minutes or so. Cook your favourite pasta in generously salted water (think of sea water as a reference, the pasta will thank you), mix it with the sauce and enjoy. `,

    There are many ways to prepare zucchini, making it a versatile ingredient in the kitchen. Zucchini can be grilled, sautéed, baked, or enjoyed raw in salads.\n

    I love to roast them in the oven, although they always tend to take a little longer than I think they will, due to their high water content. Give them time to brown and caramelise for a surprisingly delightful result.
    \n
    Zucchini pairs well with a variety of herbs and spices, such as garlic, basil, and thyme, adding depth and aroma to your recipes.`,
    recipe: `Cut the Zucchini into chunks, mix it with olive oil and salt and pop them in the oven at a moderately high heat. Once they’re nicely browned, put them in a bowl or wide plate, sprinkle with lemon juice zest, finely cut fresh mint and some freshly ground pepper. Eat immediately or at room temperature.`,
