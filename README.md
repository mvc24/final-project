# sage - a culinary inspiration web app

This project is a web application dedicated to empowering culinary creativity by offering curated vegetarian ingredient combinations rather than traditional recipes. Built during a full stack web development bootcamp, it's designed to assist users in exploring diverse cooking ideas using easily accessible pantry ingredients.
